# odin-recipes
So this is one of my first project and this will demonstrate basic html
Goals:
Use boilerplate HTML to make a h1 heading called Odin recipes to the body.
Create a new HTML file within recipes directory and name it after the recipe.
Do h1 of recipes name and its content and on indexhtml, add a link to the recipe page created.
Have a finished dish under the h1 heading added and a description heading followed by a paragraph describing the recipe.
Under that create an unordered list of the ingredient needs then an ordered list of the steps to make the recipe.
Add 2 more recipes with indentical page structures and link them to the index page.
